It is an indication to the network of how to interpret the number dialled. (I) - 2) User Identifier Number: The User Identifier Number (UIN) shall be one of the following numbers (as identified by the CT): (M) - Train Number (TN): a number given to a train by operational staff for a particular journey. This number shall be unique for the duration of the journey. - Note. For certain Train Numbers (e.g. 1234 and 123), a risk exists when dialling a number by keying in individual digits e.g. by the dispatcher. In this circumstance the risk of connecting to an un-intended train exists if there is a delay between keyed-in digits. There is no risk of ambiguity if block dialling is employed. - Engine Number (EN): a unique number given to a tractive unit to identify it permanently. The UIC has introduced a uniform identification marking system for tractive stock crossing frontiers [UIC 438-3]. In order to call a particular locomotive, it shall be possible to call a number associated with the tractive unit's stock number. The actual number of the unit, which shall be used as the EN, is based on the complete identification number. - Coach Number (CN): a unique number given to a coach (which is not a tractive unit) to identify it permanently. The UIC has introduced a uniform identification marking for passenger rolling stock [UIC 438-1]. In order to call a particular coach it shall be possible to call a number associated with the vehicle marking. The total vehicle marking consists of 12 digits. The actual number of the coach is denoted by seven digits (positions 5 to 11 of the complete vehicle marking), which shall be used as the CN7. - Shunting Team Location Number (STLN) - Maintenance Team Location Number (MTLN) - Train Controller Location Number (TCLN) - Group Location Number (GLN) - Mobile Subscriber Number (MSN) - 3) Function Code: The Function Code (FC) is used as an identification of, for example, the person or equipment on a particular train, or a particular team within a given area. - 1) Call Type (CT) This prefix defines how to interpret the User Number that follows. It shall consist of one or two digits as defined in table 9-1. - 2) User Number (UN) The UN is variable in length and depends on the information on which it is based. The following formats are defined: - Train Function Numbers (TFN) shall take one of the forms as defined in table 9-2. Leading zeros shall be used in those situations where the train number is less than five digits. - Engine Function Numbers (EFN) shall take the format as defined in table 9-3. - Coach Function Numbers (CFN) shall take the format as defined in table 9-4. - Maintenance and Shunting Team Members. The UIN field format for calls to shunting teams and maintenance teams shall consist of a Location Number (LN), which identifies the location where the called party is registered, followed by a Function Code (FC). The Location Number shall consist of 5 digits and shall be assigned on a national basis. The Function Code shall consist of 4 digits. The first digit of the FC is related to the Team Type (TT) and is specified by table 9-5. The composition of the Function Code field for calls to shunting teams and maintenance teams shall be as defined in table 9-6. - Train Controllers. The UIN field for calls to train controllers shall be a Location Number (LN) which identifies the location where the called party is registered. The Location Number shall consist of 5 digits and shall be assigned on a national basis. The FC field for calls to train controllers shall consist of two digits and be as defined in table 9-7. - Mobile Subscriber Number (MSN). The UN of the MSN shall consist of the Subscriber Number. - Group and broadcast calls. The UIN field format for group calls shall be a Service Area (SA) indicator, which identifies the area in which the group call is to be active. Each Service Area shall be allocated on a national basis. In network boundary areas, the Service Area shall be allocated on a bilateral basis. (See also subsection 9.9.)
