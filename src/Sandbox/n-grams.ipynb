    "Gensim's standard implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) does not directly support using n-grams as input for topic modeling. The LDA model in Gensim typically operates on individual words rather than n-grams.\n",
    "While Gensim offers robust tools for text preprocessing, dictionary creation, and topic modeling, the default LDA implementation focuses on word-level tokens. If you intend to incorporate n-grams into your topic modeling process using Gensim, you may need to preprocess your text data externally to generate n-grams before applying the LDA model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This additional preprocessing step would involve creating bigrams, trigrams or higher order n-grams from your text data and then feeding these n-grams into the LDA model for topic modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while Gensim's LDA model does not natively support n-grams, it is possible to preprocess the text to generate n-grams and then use those as input to the LDA model. But this requires additional custom preprocessing steps outside of Gensim's standard LDA implementation."
